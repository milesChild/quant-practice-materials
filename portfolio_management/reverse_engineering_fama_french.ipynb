    "# Reverse-Engineering the Fama-French Five Factor Model Using Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Miles Child\n",
    "November 18, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will isolate the factor loadings for five of the Fama-French factors on the S&P 100 and attempt to reconstruct them using PCA. I have run Fama-French in the past and have been attracted to the qualitative explainability of Fama-French and detracted by the concept that five intuitions can explain the majority of asset return variance. With PCA, I have been attracted to the abstract methodology of explaining asset return variance but detracted from the inability to rationalize why these latent variables exist and why they should continue to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal components will be \"matched\" with the Fama-French factors on the basis of statistical correlation between their factor loadings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unmatchable components will be assumed to be either (1) one of the other fama-french factors, (2) some other known but not fama-french factor, or **(3) idiosyncratic factors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully I am successful in this reverse-engineering so that a middle-ground can be identified (this seems like something that's been done a million times before but I'm going to do it anyway for better understanding of both factor isolation methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "See fama_french.ipynb and pca.ipynb in lib/ for independent examples of the two.\n",
